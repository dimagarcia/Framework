abstract = {In many multivariate domains, we are interested in analyzing the
dependency structure of the underlying distribution, e.g., whether two
variables are in direct interaction. We can represent dependency
structures using Bayesian network models. To analyze a given data set,
Bayesian model selection attempts to find the most likely (MAP) model,
and uses its structure to answer these questions. However, when the
amount of available data is modest, there might be many models that have
non-negligible posterior. Thus, we want compute the Bayesian posterior
of a feature, i.e., the total posterior probability of all models that
contain it. In this paper, we propose a new approach for this task. We
first show how to efficiently compute a sum over the exponential number
of networks that are consistent with a fixed order over network
variables. This allows us to compute, for a given order, both the
marginal probability of the data and the posterior of a feature. We then
use this result as the basis for an algorithm that approximates the
Bayesian posterior of a feature. Our approach uses a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) method, but over orders rather than over network
structures. The space of orders is smaller and more regular than the
space of structures, and has much a smoother posterior ``landscape{\{}''{\}}.
We present empirical results on synthetic and real-life datasets that
compare our approach to full model averaging (when possible), to MCMC
over network structures, and to a non-Bayesian bootstrap approach.},
