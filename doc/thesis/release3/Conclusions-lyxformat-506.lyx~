\begin_layout Plain Layout
Although the number of SLiM-mediated PPIs might be small, there is evidence
 that these PPIs are used by several viruses, in contrast to virus-host
 domain-domain PPIs, that are virus-specific

.
 This kind of interactions can help to analyze common viral strategies for
 infection.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We develop a bioinformatic method to predict virus-host SLiM-mediated PPIs
 and rank them.
 It is applicable to any eukaryotic virus and host with available protein
 sequences.
 The requirements for the method are: 1) the availability of a reference
 genome for the virus, 2) the availability of viral sequences, 3) protein-domain
 associations for the host organism, 4) the ELM-database of SLiMs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using data for the most studied virus, HIV-1, we find a partial ordering
 of the PPIs obtained based on the set used to infer the interactions.
 The order consists in two blocks: 
\begin_inset Formula $D\cup R,C\cup R$
\end_inset

.
 This order is descending in the expected probability of inferring real
 interactions.
 We expect that the method gives interesting candidate interactions with
 other eukaryotic viruses and hosts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the HIV-1 conserved motifs are located in disordered regions, suggesting
 that protein structural flexibility could be an important factor to accommodate
 SLiMs to mimic host proteins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although there are machine learning methods for predicting host-pathogen
 PPIs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pmid25375323,pmid17646292"

\end_inset

, the descriptors they use are primarily based on domain-domain interactions,
 not on motif-domain interactions.
 We consider our approach as a different way to obtain candidate interactions
 and rank them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The call for using high-throughput methods to detect SLiM-mediated PPIs
 illustrates the benefits of a bioinformatic method that predicts SLiM-mediated
 PPIs and might guide experimental design

Future work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The recent study of fuzziness and SLiM flanking regions opens a window to
 understand more the nature of SLiM-mediated PPIs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pmid26289637"

\end_inset

.
 Advances in this direction might result in better SLiM filtering methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An additional filter to consider is if the protein binding region in the
 host protein interacting with a SLiM is disordered, as deemed by a predictor
 like ANCHOR

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another possible addition is a filtering method based on structural properties
 of the SLiM like being exposed at the protein surface like it is done in

 Indeed, there is a previous work that proposes to extend the notion of
 SLiM to include a structural component

We performed the prediction of SLiM-mediated host-virus PPIs between the
 human HPSM and some selected viruses.
 However, the methods proposed can be extended to other subsystems like
