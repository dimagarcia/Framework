\begin_layout Section*
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Protein-protein interactions are used to understand the biological organization
 of an organism by creating models like metabolic, regulation, signaling
 and interaction networks.
 In the same way, virus-host protein-protein interactions (VHPPIs
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
prefix "VHPPIs"
symbol "VHPPIs"
description "Virus-Host Protein-Protein Interactions"

\end_inset

) are used to create models aimed at understand viral pathogenesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason VHPPIs are inputs to formulate pathogenesis models is that viruses
 interact with their hosts in order to disrupt or modulate pathways achieving
 goals like evading the complement system 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pmid18341208"

\end_inset

, modulating the cytokine system 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pmid12511874"

\end_inset

 and abrogating apoptosis 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pmid12734412"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of these protein-protein interactions (PPIs
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "PPIs"
description "Protein-Protein Interactions"

\end_inset

) are based on viral mimicry.
 A viral protein (VP) resembling a host protein (HP) might interact with
 other host proteins, the ones that interact with HP.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Classic definition of molecular mimicry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oldstone defined molecular mimicry in reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 as: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
The sharing of a linear amino acid sequence or a conformation fit between
 a microbe and a host ‘self’ determinant is the initial stage of molecular
 mimicry.
 Autoimmunity may occur if the host immune response against the microbe
 cross-reacts with the host’s ‘self’ sequence and if the host sequence comprises
 a biologically important domain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a balance between the pathogen virulence and the host immune system
 response.
 This response consist in the generation of antibodies to bind pathogen
 proteins.
 The antibody-bound pathogen proteins are degraded by the immuno-proteasome
 into peptides.
 These peptides are presented by proteins in the Major histocompatibility
 complex (MHC) to appropriate immune T-cells.
 The T-cells decide if cells are infected by pathogens and initiate apoptosis.
 MHC class I proteins present cytosolic peptides and MHC class II proteins
 display extracellular peptides.
 The immune system can go out of control when the peptides are identical
 to a host protein component and start to attack host cells unfolding an
 autoimmune disease like insulin-dependent diabetes and Guillain-Barré syndrome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An individual immune system response depends on its genetic predisposition
 and environmental factors like pathogen infection history.
 The results can be: 1) initiation of autoimmune processes when pathogens
 have an epitope (a part of a pathogenic protein that binds to an antibody)
 identical to a host protein component; 2) acceleration of ongoing autoimmune
 processes by subsequent infections, when the different pathogens have very
 similar epitopes, and these epitopes have similarity to host protein components
; and 3) abrogation of autoimmunity by subsequent infections, through different
 mechanisms like inflammation that cause hyperactivation of lymphocytes,
 that in turn, may diminish the number of aggressive T cells

Molecular mimicry definition used in this thesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of mimicry we are going to use throughout the thesis is the one
 presented in reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pmid21408160"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
We refer here to molecular mimicry as the display of any structure by the
 parasite that (i) resembles structures of the host at the molecular level
 and (ii) confers a benefit to the parasite because of this resemblance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or the similar one presented in reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pmid19806153"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
We define mimics as pathogen-encoded factors that resemble host factors
 in order to co-opt or disrupt host functions to the pathogen’s advantage.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From now on, viral mimicry is considered as any molecular resemblance to
 host proteins based on sequence or structural similarity that confers the
 virus ways to hijack or disrupt host pathways.
 This definition of molecular mimicry is adopted because it serves the purpose
 of finding virus-host interactions more than the classical one.
 The classical is more suited to investigate autoimmune disorders though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis is centered in the prediction VHPPIs based on mimicked protein
 portions known as short linear motifs (SLiMs
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "SLiMs"
description "Short Linear Motifs"

\end_inset

) and the analysis of the interactions obtained to find candidate viral
 strategies based in this kind of mimicry.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Justification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Systems biology approaches use VHPPIs to formulate hypothesis about viral
 infection mechanisms 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pmid25914674"

\end_inset

.
 The hypothesis obtained are aimed at developing antivirals and vaccines
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pmid23025912,pmid23938265,9783527648221,pmid23057872"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the scarcity of VHPPIs with experimental evidence support is an
 obstacle to system biology approaches 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pmid23193100"

\end_inset

.
 This lack of data has fostered the development of VHPPI prediction methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prediction methods use sequences as inputs because the low cost of next
 generation sequencing technologies has allowed to sequence a big number
 of host and pathogen genomes.
 Furthermore, the genome sequencing costs are declining as new technologies
 emerge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, there are few 3D protein structures determined for hosts
 and viruses in the protein data bank (PDB
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "PDB"
description "Protein Data Bank"

\end_inset

), the main repository of protein structural information 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pmid23193259"

\end_inset

.
 These 3D structures could be used as input for structure-based PPI prediction
 methods like the one implemented in reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pmid20426868"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The abundance of sequenced genomes and viral protein sequences have allowed
 the development of several bioinformatic methods to predict VHPPIs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pmid25375323,pmid22595002,pmid20426868,pmid17646292,pmid21382517,pmid25759684,pmid16450363"

\end_inset

.
 Most of the prediction methods developed are machine learning classifiers
 like random forests 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pmid22114664"

\end_inset

 and support vector machines 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pmid25375323,pmid22595002,pmid21382517"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of these classifiers use protein sequences and other features like
 gene ontology (GO
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "GO"
description "Gene Ontology"

\end_inset

) function, gene co-expression, homology with similar organisms and cellular
 localization among others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the classifiers face two problems: the missing data problem, that all
 the proteins have no data for some features 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pmid22962468"

\end_inset

; and the negative training data problem, the adequate choosing of negative
 examples — pairs of non-interacting proteins– for training 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pmid16723005"

\end_inset

.
 Indeed, the good performance of the classifiers reported in the literature
 can be a consequence of the biased selection of negative examples 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pmid16723005"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another problem with machine learning methods lies in the difficulty to
 interpret biologically the inference of the results of a properly trained
 classifier.
 The inference of VHPPIs ends up encoded in neuron weights or support vector
 values, there is no a high level explanation of the inference process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lack of 3D structures for structural prediction methods and protein
 features for machine learning classifiers introduced above underscore the
 importance of methods based only on protein sequences which is the case
 for the method developed in this thesis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another property of the method developed is that it leads to a straightforward
 biological explanation of the interactions inference process.
 Indeed, the inference of interactions based on SLiMs uses criteria as SLiM
 conservation, SLiM localization in protein structurally disordered regions
 and difficulty to form SLiMs by pure chance that have a biological foundation
 in evolution, protein structure and probability, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recently, the role of SLiMs has been studied in a wide set of viruses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pmid24882001"

\end_inset

.
 The authors conclude that viruses use extensively SLiMs as means to interact
 with host proteins.
 Also, human proteins targeted by viruses have a high number of SLiMs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pmid25417202"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An analysis of VHPPIs with experimental support shows that if the interactions
 are classified in domain-motif interactions (DMI
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "DMI"
description "Domain-Motif Interaction"

\end_inset

) and domain-domain interactions (DDI
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "DDI"
description "Domain-Domain Interaction"

\end_inset

), DMI are the predominant ones.
 Furthermore, DMI are used by several viruses while DDI are virus-specific
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pmid25417202"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the reasons introduced above, the viral use of SLiMs and DMI predominance/re
use, we argue that virus-host interactions mediated by SLiMs can be used
 to analyze common viral attack strategies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As there is no a gold-standard data set for VHPPIs to validate a prediction
 method we use the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "HIV-1"
description "Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1"

\end_inset

) to analyze the VHPPIs deduced used SLiMs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As HIV-1 is a human retrovirus that disables the immune system, mutates
 extraordinarily fast 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and infects so many people around the world it has been extensively investigate
d.
 This makes it the virus with more bioinformatic data available, with the
 USA National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID 
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "NIAID"
description "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (USA)"

\end_inset

) databases for sequences and alignments 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pmid12875108"

\end_inset

 and for interactions with human proteins 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pmid18927109"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Viruses must subvert different subsystems to infect the host cell and replicate.
 Although viruses have an extraordinary variability, all must subvert the
 host protein synthesis machinery (HPSM
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "HPSM"
description "Host Protein Synthesis Machinery"

\end_inset

) in order to translate viral proteins.
 That is the reason we choose this particular subsystem for study of common
 viral infection strategies.
 We select a group of human viruses with available sequences targeting the
 host protein-synthesis machinery as a case study.

Previous work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eukaryotic organisms have an estimated huge number of SLiM instances in
 their proteins, more than a million in humans
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pmid25038412"

\end_inset

.
 These SLiMs are used as dynamic interaction anchors than can appear and
 disappear with small mutations and tune host protein-protein interaction
 networks (PPIN) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pmid15943979"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first investigation to predict VHPPI with base on SLiMs was conducted
 by Evans et al.
 with HIV-1 and human proteins 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pmid19450270"

\end_inset

.
 The authors use SLiM conservation as a criterion to filter SLiM instances
 before inferring the interactions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A massive study of SLiM use with 2208 different viral genomes was conducted
 by Hagai et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pmid24882001"

\end_inset

.
 The authors find that SLiM instances are prevalent in viral protein sequences,
 even more in eukaryotic than prokaryotic organisms.
 They propose localization in protein disordered regions and difficulty
 to form by pure chance as criteria to filter SLiM instances.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, they find that SLiM instances emerge in viruses by convergent
 evolution predominantly and not by horizontal gene transfer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pmid24882001"

\end_inset

.
 This suggests that unrelated viruses can use the same SLiMs in host proteins
 to bridge new interactions or disrupt existing pathways, supporting our
 aim of finding common viral infection mechanisms based on mimicry.

Aunque es válido el enfoque de péptidos lineales para identificar similitudes
 entre proteínas, es importante tener en cuenta que la predicción se hace
 sobre estructuras primarias de péptidos cortos, en ellas no se ha tenido
 en cuenta el medio acuoso que, es un factor importante pues condiciona
 el plegamiento de estructuras secundaria y terciaria, que tienen grados
 de estabilidad variables y estructuras transicionales que afecta las constante
 de binding de los dominios involucrados en MM.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although protein-protein interactions take place on the basis of the interacting
 proteins 3D structure, we only use sequence information in this thesis
 to predict interactions.
 We do not use 3D protein information because the number of viral protein
 structures in PDB is small.
 This decision prevent us from including the role of water in the interactions
 that can be very influential facilitating the interactions and conditioning
 the folding of interacting proteins into secondary and tertiary structures.
