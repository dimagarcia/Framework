\begin_layout Section
General Objective
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main objective of this thesis is to develop a computational model and
 platform for predicting virus-host protein-protein interactions mediated
 by short linear motifs and analyze viruses subversion strategies of the
 host protein-synthesis machinery based on short linear motif mimicry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Specific Objectives 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Select proper data sets to develop and test the model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
We choose HIV-1 sequences and interactions with human proteins to calibrate
 the method.
 For the host protein-synthesis machinery, the subset of human proteins
 was constructed following reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and the Uniprot database

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Generalize the approach of Evans et al.
 to any virus with sequenced genome in order to predict interactions based
 on common SLiMs between human and viral proteins.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
We generalize the Evans et al.
 approach for any eukaryotic virus using the ELM database SLiM-domain associatio
ns 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, and Pfam domain-protein associations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 to get the SLiM-protein associations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pmid19450270"

\end_inset

.
 We implement algorithms to count and measure the conservation of SLiMs
 in the viral sequences.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Extend the approach of Evans et al.
 with the criteria of protein structural disorder and randomization of proteins
 to find SLiMs hard to form by pure chance.
\begin_inset Separator latexpar
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
We extend the criterion of conserved common SLiMs proposed by Evans et al
 with the notion of SLiM localization in protein disordered regions using
 a protein disorder prediction strategy based on protein sequence only.
 We also implement the notion of difficulty of finding motifs by pure chance
 in protein randomized sets proposed by Hagai et al.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Conduct a case study of the computational model proposed on a specific virus.
\begin_inset Separator latexpar
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
We calibrate the method developed by comparing how the three criteria of
 SLiM filtering – conservation, localization in disordered regions, difficulty
 to form by pure chance – perform at predicting virus-host protein-protein
 interactions.
 We use HIV-1 to analyze the results because is the virus with more abundant
 information.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Conduct a case study of the analysis with several human viruses on the HPSM.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
We focus on the HPSM subsystem because all viruses subvert it to translate
 their proteins.
 We focus on human as host to obtain insights into common viral infection
 strategies.
 These insights could be relevant to prevent viral infectious diseases.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Create a computational tool, implementing the developed model and the correspond
ing algorithms, to be used by bioinformaticians to study viral infections.

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
We develop a set of scripts written in the Python programming language,
 using the libraries Biopython, Pandas and NetworkX.
 The scripts are general enough to be used with any eukaryotic virus, using
 the Fasta format for protein sequences and Uniprot identifiers for proteins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting interactions are generated in CSV
